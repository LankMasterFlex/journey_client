A c++ client for the Journey MMORPG server. This project is part of a development thread on ragezone: https://forum.ragezone.com/f689/journey-client-v83-1074178/

# Compiling and testing
If you want to compile and test this source, you will need to change some packets of your server. The structures of packets can be extracted from the Net folder. You will also have to disable AES encryption in your server.

# Acknowledgements
The client uses the nolifenx library by retep 998 to load assets from .nx files. Link:
